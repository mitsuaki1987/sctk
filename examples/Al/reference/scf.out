--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open MPI's OFI driver detected multiple equidistant NICs from the current process,
but had insufficient information to ensure MPI processes fairly pick a NIC for use.
This may negatively impact performance. A more modern PMIx server is necessary to
resolve this issue.

Note: This message is displayed only when the OFI component's verbosity level is
1293646000 or higher.

     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead
     [opt_tetra]  Optimized tetrahedron method is used.

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
