Features
========

Features of the main program of Superconducting-Toolkit, sctk.x,
is as follows:

-  Compute the Coulomb interaction matrix
   :math:`K^{el}_{n {\bf k} n' {\bf k}'}` as a preprocess.
   This program uses Kohn-Sham orbitals generated by QE.
-  Solve the gap equation and obtain the superconducting
   gap function :math:`\Delta_{n {\bf k}}`.
-  Solve the gap equation and obtain the superconducting
   transition temperature with the bisection method.
-  Perform non-SCF calculation for generating files readable by FermiSurfer_.
-  Perform non-SCF calculation for obtaining quasi particle density of states.
-  Perform non-SCF calculation for obtaining ultrasonic attenuation
   coefficient(experimental).

Also, there is a script :ref:`twingrid` to generate the :math:`{\bf k}`-point grid
where Kohn-Sham orbitals
for :ref:`the calculation of the Coulomb interaction <kel>` are computed.
